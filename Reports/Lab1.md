## Overview
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Cryptography consists a part of the science known as Cryptology. The other part is Cryptanalysis. There are a lot of different algorithms/mechanisms used in Cryptography, but in the scope of these laboratory works the students need to get familiar with some examples of each kind.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; First, it is important to understand the basics so for the first task students will need to implement a classical and relatively simple cipher. This would be the Caesar cipher which uses substitution to encrypt a message. 

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; In it's simplest form, the cipher has a key which is used to substitute the characters with the next ones, by the order number in a pre-established alphabet. Mathematically it would be expressed as follows:

$em = enc_{k}(x) = x + k (mod \; n),$

$dm = dec_{k}(x) = x + k (mod \; n),$ 

where:
- em: the encrypted message,
- dm: the decrypted message (i.e. the original one),
- x: input,
- k: key,
- n: size of the alphabet.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Judging by the encryption mechanism one can conclude that this cipher is pretty easy to break. In fact, a brute force attack would have __*O(nm)*__ complexity, where __*n*__ would be the size of the alphabet and __*m*__ the size of the message. This is why there were other variations of this cipher, which are supposed to make the cryptanalysis more complex.


## Objectives:
1. Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.

2. Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:
    - Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution (as explained above),
    - Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution, and a permutation of the alphabet,
    - Vigenere cipher,
    - Playfair cipher.
    - If you want you can implement other.

3. Structure the project in methods/classes/packages as neeeded.
